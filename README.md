# 🏦 Banking Network Simulation – Cisco Packet Tracer  

## 📌 Overview  
This project simulates a **banking network** in **Cisco Packet Tracer**, designed to demonstrate real-world enterprise networking.  

### 🌐 Features  
✅ **Full enterprise-level network configuration**  
✅ **Router and switch setup** for optimal performance  
✅ **Inter-network communication strategies**  
✅ **Access point and server configurations** (DHCP, DNS, email)  
✅ **Troubleshooting Cisco Packet Tracer’s quirks** 💀  

## 🛠 Technical Skills Demonstrated  
### 🏗 Layer 2 & Layer 3 Networking  
- VLANs, trunking, static routing, and **OSPF**  
### 🏢 Enterprise-Level Network Design  
- **Scalability, redundancy, and efficiency** optimization  
### 🔒 Security Best Practices  
- **Access control lists (ACLs), SSH, and port security**  
### 📡 Wireless Networking  
- **Configuring SSIDs, access points, and encryption**  
### 🖥 Server Management  
- **DHCP, DNS, and email server configurations**  

## 🔧 Known Issues & Fixes  
❌ **Issue:** Packet not transferring between VLANs  
✔️ **Fix:** Enable **IP routing** on the router and check **trunking configurations**  

❌ **Issue:** Switch doesn’t recognize VLAN interfaces  
✔️ **Fix:** Use `no shutdown` on VLAN interfaces  

❌ **Issue:** Cisco Packet Tracer freezes when moving the mouse  
✔️ **Fix:** There is no fix. **Suffer.** 💀
